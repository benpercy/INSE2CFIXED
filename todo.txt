TODO:
Make ATLEAST the first 4 homepage products work
If not enough credit, don't sell
If topup amount is greater than £1000, don't allow (don't allow negatives)
Top-up validation (16 digit card, password, 3 digit SC, checkbox)

LOOK INTO:
Add a cart page with current user session products (eh?) (ability to multiple order)
Order tracking
Admin panel - Access to all users information because yay security.
Look into changing all directory listings to absolutes from root (maybe) - Fix file structures
Improve overall design (where possible)
